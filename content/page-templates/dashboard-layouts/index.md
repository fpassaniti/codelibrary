These resources are split into 2 main parts

1. Resources built with standard ODS Layout
2. The same resources, built with the [CSS Grid framework layout](/page-templates/css-grid-framework)

To see the final example made with these layouts, go to [dashboard resource](/page-templates/dashboard).

**ODS Layout** is well known from Opendatasoft users, and these resources over-ride it by setting `row` as `display: flex` 
elements to take advantage of Flexbox capabilities. You can see the [ODS Layout over-ride resource here](/page-templates/ods-layout-over-ride).

**CSS Grid framework** refer to some custom CSS classes that over-rides CSS Grid layout. It's mainly suitable for **expert users only** that are looking for more advanced layouts such as grids and multiple rows designs. 
We strongly encourage you to have a look to the [CSS Grid framework resource](/page-templates/css-grid-framework) before using it. And be assured that your needs really justify the use of this advanced layout system.

**Why should you use this framework ?**

- adaptive height between cells of a same row.
- automatic gap management (ie. no need of complex margins, with negative paddings on rows coupled with positive margins on columns).
- reduced HTML depth/complexity, specially for nested grids (ie. avoid deep HTML trees of a box in a column in a row in a column in a row... here the cell, the grid and the box can be the same element!).
- mobile first, then force you to think about the mobile layout before the desktop one.
- 2D grid instead of 1D row (flexbox, width %, float)



**Why shouldn't you use this framework ?**

You shouldn't use this framework if you are not familiar with CSS debugging, browser consoles, inspection tab etc...

This framework has a stiffer learning curve than ODS default layout system.
Therefore, if you want to develop quickly without spending time learning more advanced techniques, you should skip this resource.
On the other hand, if you are ready to learn new techniques to develop advanced and complex grids, it's a good starting point !

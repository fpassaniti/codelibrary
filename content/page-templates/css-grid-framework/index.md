This resource introduces a **CSS Grid based framework** to empower Opendatasoft users to do their own layouts. 

**CSS Grid** is the most modern and performant way to structure pages. 

A **framework** is a set of CSS classes to set into the HTML to easily develop nice looking pages. 

This framework covers :
  - the split into 12 columns 
  - the row positioning
  - the ordering of elements

> Note: this framework is used by ODS Labs team for some resources. 
> It is not intended to replace ODS default layout already used in pages. 
> It's an alternative for **power users**, looking for advanced tools, specially designed for 2 dimensions layouts instead of one.
> You should also consider that CSS Grid layout or Flexbox are already available in very browser and can directly be used on the platform without any required framework.

This resource introduces a **CSS Grid framework** based on CSS Grid layout system.  

> It's an alternative to ODS Layout system, suitable for **expert users**, looking for more advanced layout system, specially designed for 2 dimensions layouts instead of one.

**CSS Grid** is the most modern and performant way to structure pages. 

A **framework** is a set of CSS classes to set into the HTML to easily develop nice looking pages. 

This framework covers :
  - the split into 12 columns 
  - the row positioning
  - the ordering of elements

> Note: this framework is used by ODS Labs team for some resources. 
> It is not intended to replace ODS default layout already used in pages.
> You should also consider that CSS Grid layout or Flexbox are already available in every browser and can directly be used on the platform without any required framework.

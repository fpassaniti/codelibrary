As for columns, a specific number of rows can be set to a grid.
The main benefit is to have an equal size for all children (cells) in the grid.
It's then also possible to span cells on several rows.

Use `grid-rows-{n}` class to create grids with n equally sized rows.

Use `cell-row-span-{n}`, `cell-row-start-{n}`, `cell-row-end-{n}` classes to, respectively, make an element span n rows, set its start position, end position.

This resource is an over-ride of ODS default layout system by transforming a `row` and it's children into a Flexbox layout.  

**Flexbox** brings two major benefits compared to the actual layout :

- Equal height of children of a same row
- re-ordering elements

**If any of these two benefits are useful to your project, there is no interest in using this resource !**

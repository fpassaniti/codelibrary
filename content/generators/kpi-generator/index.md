This generator build a KPI wall. 

With specific parameters for each KPI card, it will compare values, compute a progression or analyse how your data evolved over time on a specific period. 

Like any other generator, it deals with all the complexity of manipulating dates, refining specific context, computing and comparing aggregation etc...

As the code is complex, and the resource might be difficult to reuse, we consider it experimental and share it in an early stage. Do not hesitate to send us your feedbacks, we highly appreciate your help to make this generator evolve.

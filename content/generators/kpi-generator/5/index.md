title: "Compare different fields or datasets"
---

As the settings for the KPI and the reference value are separated, they can be computed from different fields or datasets.

In this example:
- 1st KPI compares **different fields**: 2007 France population and 2012 France population. 
- 2nd KPI compares **different datasets**: population in France vs population in Belgium

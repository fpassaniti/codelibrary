The **ods-analysis** output is a json object, containing one key **results**.
It's value is a json array and each item contains the **x** value of the analysis, and **one to many series**.

Compare, side-by-side the ods-chart values and the ods-analysis results. They both have the same settings (x axis, series, number of results and sort parameters)

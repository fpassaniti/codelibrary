Ods-analysis results can also be processed to get the minimum and maximum value of a serie, and also compute the length of the array. By doing so, you can get interesting information like the biggest city or smallest city in your dataset by summing the population as a serie for example.

When you analyse your domain statistics, you can compute an ods-analysis with the user ID or IP address as the X axis, and then get the length of the ods-analysis results. It then correspond to the number of different users that reached your domain.

In the following example, we get the best or worst universities, by ranking score.

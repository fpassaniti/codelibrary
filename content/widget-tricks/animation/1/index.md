Animate your KPI with `ods-timer`. 

The KPI is computed with `ods-aggregation`. You can change the speed of the animation by changing 2 variables:

>`nbticks`: number of steps to change the KPI. High value = many steps before reaching the final KPI.

>`delay`: delay between each tick. High delay = slow animation.

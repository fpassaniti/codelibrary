**Important note**

By using these types of headers, you will note be able to link the menu items to the ones you enter in the back office of your domain (https://yourdomain.opendatasoft.com/backoffice/customization/navigation/).
These customed headers will recreate the navigation bar and you will have to enter the title and the link for each  of them, in the HTML code.

Moreover, you will not be able to have a specific CSS class for the active items (no hover effect/underline when an item to highlight the active page).

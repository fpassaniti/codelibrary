**Important note**

_By using these types of headers, you will note be able to link the menu items to the ones you enter in the back-office of your domain (`https://yourdomain.opendatasoft.com/backoffice/customization/navigation/`)_. _These customed headers will recreate the navigation bar and you will have to enter the title and the link for each  of them, in the HTML code_.

_Moreover, you will not be able to have a specific CSS class for the active items (no background/underline effect on an item title to highlight the active page)_.

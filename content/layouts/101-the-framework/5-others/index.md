Use simply `grid` to create a grid. The algorithm will automatically place cells depending on `cell-*` classes seen previously.

Use `grid-cols-auto-flow`, `grid-rows-auto-flow` classes to control how the auto-placement algorithm works for a grid layout. `grid-auto` shortcut stands for columns auto flow. 

Use `grid-cols-fit`, `grid-rows-fit` classes to control the size implicitly-created grid columns and rows and make it fit the content.

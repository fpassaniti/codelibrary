Why should you use this framework ?

- adaptive height between cells of a same row.
- automatic gap management (ie. no need of complex margins, with negative paddings on rows coupled with positive margins on columns).
- reduced HTML depth/complexity, specially for nested grids (ie. avoid deep HTML trees of a box in a column in a row in a column in a row... here the cell, the grid and the box can be the same element!).
- mobile first, then force you to think about the mobile layout before the desktop one.
- 2D grid instead of 1D row (flexbox, width %, float)
